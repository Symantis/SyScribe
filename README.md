SyScribe
========

The Angular.js IDE/GUI hybrid for the Symantis Creator App

SyScribe works as an Angluar.js GUI/IDE interface for SyQuery which is used in the Symantis "Creator App" (working title) that runs on Sails.js. It allows for drag 'n drop "SyQuery" fragments. SyQuery fragments are essentially Angular.js partials/directives/services/controllers and SCSS stored as JSON.

SyScribe also works with Sails.js's websockets so SyQuery fragments can be updated in "Realtime."
